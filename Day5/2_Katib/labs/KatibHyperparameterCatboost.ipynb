    "# Hyperparameter Tuning with Katib (Catboost)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing a model's hyperparameter values in order to maximize the predictive quality of the model.\n",
    "Examples of such hyperparameters are the learning rate, neural architecture depth (layers) and width (nodes), epochs, batch size, dropout rate, and activation functions.\n",
    "These are the parameters that are set prior to training; unlike the model parameters (weights and biases), these do not change during the process of training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can create and configure an `Experiment` for a catboost model.\n",
    "In terms of Kubernetes, such an experiment is a custom resource handled by the Katib operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Specify Hyperparameters in Your Models\n",
    "In order for Katib to be able to tweak hyperparameters it needs to know what these are called in the model.\n",
    "Beyond that, the model must specify these hyperparameters either as regular (command line) parameters or as environment variables.\n",
    "Since the model needs to be containerized, any command line parameters or environment variables must to be passed to the container that holds your model.\n",
    "By far the most common and also the recommended way is to use command line parameters that are captured with [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or similar; the trainer (function) then uses their values internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Expose Model Metrics as Objective Functions\n",
    "By default, Katib collects metrics from the standard output of a job container by using a sidecar container.\n",
    "In order to make the metrics available to Katib, they must be logged to [stdout](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/hyperparameter-tuning/experiment/#metrics-collector) in the `key=value` format.\n",
    "The job output will be redirected to `/var/log/katib/metrics.log` file.\n",
    "This means that the objective function (for Katib) must match the metric's `key` in the models output.\n",
    "It's therefore possible to define custom model metrics for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create Experiments\n",
    "Before we proceed, let's set up a few basic definitions that we can re-use.\n",
    "Note that you typically use (YAML) resource definitions for Kubernetes from the command line, but we shall show you how to do everything from a notebook, so that you do not have to exit your favourite environment at all!\n",
    "Of course, if you are more familiar or comfortable with `kubectl` and the command line, feel free to use a local CLI or the embedded terminals from the Jupyter Lab launch screen."
