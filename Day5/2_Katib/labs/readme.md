# Day 5


On day 5 of the Kubeflow training we will go over the concept of Katib for Hyperparameter Tuning.

      a.) Build a katib experiment

      b.) Write the experiment to a yaml file

      c.) Deploy the yaml file in the Katib UI

      d.) View the results of your experiment

The experiments we would run for the labs are based on: 
   
     a.   Pytorch

     b.   Tensorflow

     c.   Catboost
