# Day 5


On day 5 of the Kubeflow training we will go over the concept of Katib for Hyperparameter Tuning. To get your hyperparameter tuning done with katib you should follow these steps:
      
      a.) Train your model
      
      b.) Build a Docker image for your job/operator with the training file
      
      c.) Run your Job
      
      d.) Build a katib experiment

      e.) Write the experiment to a yaml file

      f.) Deploy the yaml file in the Katib UI

      g.) View the results of your experiment

The experiments we would run for the labs are based on: 
   
     a.   Pytorch

     b.   Tensorflow

     c.   Catboost
