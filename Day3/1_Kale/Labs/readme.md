## NOTE 

### Kale Pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaim

In order to data, Kale mounts a data volume on each pipeline step. Since steps can run concurrently, your storage class needs to support RWX (ReadWriteMany) volumes. If that is not the case, the pod will be left unschedulable as it won't find this kind of resource.

What you can do in this case is either install a storage class that enables RWX volumes or:

  1. Retrieve the `.py` file generated by Kale (it should be next to the `.ipynb`)
  2. Search for marshal_vop definition (`marshal_vop = dsl.VolumeOp...`)
  3. Change this line `modes=dsl.VOLUME_MODE_RWM`, to `modes=dsl.VOLUME_MODE_RWO`
  4. Run the .py file
